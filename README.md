# ToDoList

This is a simple to do list app that makes use of local storage.
The user can add items and cross them out and use the button at the bottom to clear out any crossed out tasks.

There is still some work to do. 
Namely,the completed task button sometimes needs to be clicked twice to completely clear the list, and the data isn't being removed from local storage.

I plan to fix this issue moving forward, and I would like to add the ability to remove a task whether it is checked or not.
